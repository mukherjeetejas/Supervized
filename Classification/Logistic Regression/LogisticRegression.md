## Logistic Regression
**When to use?**
You should think about using logistic regression when your _Y_ variable takes on only two values. Such a variable is referred to a “binary” or “dichotomous.” “Dichotomous” basically means two categories such as yes/no, defective/non-defective, success/failure, and so on. “Binary” refers to 0’s and 1’s.
**Pros:**

 1. Simple and linear
 2. Reliable
3. No parameters to tune

**Cons:**

 1. Cannot handle non-linearities in the data
